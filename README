The Crawler.py has two functions: CityInput() and the CityFinal(). 

The function of the CityInput() is to parse the raw city data. 
The input of the raw city data's name should be: "RawCities.txt".(the city data will be downloaded easily from the link: www.topix.com/city) And the format of the "RawCities.txt" should be: [City], [State]. The output file of this function would be: "Output.txt" and the format of which would be: [City]|[State] (in the City part, all the space char in the raw data will be replaced by '+', that's for the geocoding's sake)

The fuction of the CityFinal() is to do geocoding, namely to get the geo-coordinates given the city's and the state's name.
The input file's name of the function is: "Output.txt"(the same file as the output file from the CityInput() function), the format of which was discussed in previous. The output file of the function is: "FinalOutput.txt". The format of the function is: [CountryName]|[City Parent Division]|[CityName]|[Variant Names]|[Coordinate]

The most inportant input is the "RawCities.txt" file with the right format.
